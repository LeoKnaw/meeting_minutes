The meeting discussed the phenomenon of speaking in tongues (donde lenguas), tracing its historical origins to the early 20th century, particularly to Agnes Osmond and Charles Parham, who associated it with spiritual perfection and evidence of higher spirituality. The discussion noted that Osmond's claims of speaking actual languages shifted to an interpretation of speaking in a heavenly language after a failed mission trip. The conversation explored psychological and social dimensions, emphasizing how cultural changes and emotional contagion can impact experiences of don de lenguas. Key biblical passages regarding speaking in tongues were examined, noting their context and interpretation. The meeting also highlighted contrasting arguments for and against the validity of don de lenguas today, including concerns about lack of biblical order and potential for manipulation.
